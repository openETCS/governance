\section{Introduction} % Section 1
\label{sec:Introduction}

This chapter introduces the concept of Software Configuration Management (SCM), describes the purpose and scope of this document and defines references, guidelines and standards as well as key terms, abbreviations and acronyms.


\subsection{Purpose} % Subsection 1.1
\label{sec:Purpose}

This document is the Software Configuration Management Plan (SCMP) for the openETCS project. It defines the methods and tools to identify and control the software and its functional attributes throughout its development and use. It also documents how and when these methods and tools are to be used, states who is responsible, and specifies the required resources.

The overall purpose is to maintain software integrity and configuration traceability during the entire software life cycle (including development as well as maintenance). The intended audience of the SCMP are persons involved in or responsible for this process. Roles and responsibilities as well as respective activities are defined or referred to in the corresponding sections of this SCMP (see sections \ref{sec:Responsibilities} and \ref{sec:SCM Activities}).


\subsection{Scope } %Subsection 1.2
\label {sec:Scope}

This SCMP applies to the entire life cycle of critical software as well as to noncritical software and software already developed within the context of the openETCS project. It provides technical and supervising direction to ensure that SCM activities are successfully implemented for the openETCS project.

SCM includes the following activities:

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Identification and definition of configuration items and baselines.
\item Review, approval, and control of changes.
\item Tracking and reporting of changes.
\item Audits and reviews of the software product in development.
\item Control of interface documentation.
\item Management of software release and delivery activities.
\end{itemize}

To provide all necessary information, the SCMP is structured into the following parts:

\textcolor{blue}{Note: This is the structure given in IEEE 828-2005. noted}

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction: Describes the purpose and scope of the SCMP. Also lists reference documents, guidelines and standards as well as key terms, abbreviations and acronyms.
\item SCM Management (see section \ref{sec:SCM Management}): Describes authorities and responsibilities related to managing and implementing SCM activities (i.e. who).
\item SCM Activities (see section \ref{sec:SCM Activities}): Describes the SCM activities required for the openETCS project (i.e. what).
\item SCM Schedules (see section \ref{sec:SCM Schedules}): Describes the coordination of SCM activities with other activities within the openETCS project (i.e. when).
\item SCM Resources (see section \ref{sec:SCM Resources}): Describes tools as well as physical and human resources required for SCM activities (i.e. how).
\item SCMP Maintenance (see section \ref{sec:SCMP Maintenance}): Describes how the SCMP will be updated while in effect.
\end{itemize}


\section{scope update}
\textcolor{red}{
In the current project phase the main Software delivery is called \emph{ SCADE Model}. This artifact is managed as an unitary and generic software model. The Software model is delivered according to a predefined release scheme based on a progressive iteration sequence derived from a selection of use cases sieved to provide a consistent functional scope. The generic model does not require a CI register being managed as an unique item. Standard synchronization of partial deliveries are managed according to a periodic updates of the delivery plan. For a detailed description of the roles and responsibilities reference see \cite{ADD}.
Currently the WP3 develops the generic model, which is conceived as platform independent, deferring the hardware and implementation specific issues to a later stage by WP5 and maybe by other teams adopting similar exploitation concepts in form of demonstrators or even for reuse on EVC platforms. To the purpose of a traceable neutralization and abstraction a vendor independent API concept was adopted and 
In later phase, where platform specific issue are expected it is recommended to implement the configuration management
  Possibly a SCMP and CI register could support team(s) working on the applications demonstrators. This items should be evaluated and managed in WP5 and maybe even as an indication for later use of the artifacts outside from current OpenEtcs project. If this plan is supposed to provide a better control of the different artifacts. The review from WP5 would provide the correct feedback. In the following the review items indicated as still open should be reviewed by WP5 teams with indication of preferred solution}.

\subsection{Applicable Policies, Directives and Procedures} % Subsection 2.3
\label{sec:Applicable Policies, Directives and Procedures}

As the organizational unit responsible for Quality Assurance, WP1 is responsible for the overall SCM process. Within WP1, the role Quality Assurance Manager is responsible for implementation of the SCMP and corresponding SCM activities as well as identification, assessment and management of risks related to SCM activities.

In addition, the role Configuration Manager is responsible for the content of the SCMP, the definition of SCM activities and the content of the Configuration Item Register.

Independent monitoring as well as independent identification and assessment of risks related to SCM activities is the responsibility of the role Assessor.

\textcolor{blue}{Open: Org unit for Assessor? closed assessment is currently done in WP4}

\newpage


\section{SCM Activities} % Section 3
\label{sec:SCM Activities}

This chapter describes the functions and tasks that are necessary to manage the configuration of the software system. It includes technical as well management-related SCM activities that are grouped as follows:

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Configuration item identification
\item Baseline identification
\item Configuration control
\item Configuration status accounting
\item Configuration evaluation and review
\item Interface control
\item Release management and delivery
\end{itemize}

The following figure gives an overview of how these SCM activities function together:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\caption{Overview of SCM activities}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{./Figure/SCM_Overview.png}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Configuration Item Identification} % Subsection 3.1
\label{sec:Configuration Item Identification}

Configuration identification establishes and maintains the definitive basis for configuration control of a system and its configuration items (CIs). It defines how CIs are selected, grouped, classified and defined by physical and functional characteristics. The goal is to ensure that all relevant CIs are properly identified, documented and tracked throughout their life cycle.

A CI is an entity that is subject to configuration control. CIs differ in complexity, size and type and encompass both the output of the development process (e.g. code, databases, test plans) as well as elements of the support environment (e.g. compilers, programming tools, test beds).

\textcolor{red}{Open: Not sure if the above is right. Maybe we only want to control CIs that are part of a baseline? open to review : should be decided at a later stage depending on real needs that could arise in follow ups.}

In a complex system such as the openETCS software, CIs are structured hierarchically, meaning that complex high level or so-called aggregate CIs can be subdivided into several subordinate CIs that are easier to document and control. Because it is formed of several CIs, an aggregate CI can be very similar to a baseline. The key difference is that an aggregate CI is a logical and/or convenient grouping of CIs, whereas a baseline represents a deliverable (see also section \ref{sec:Baseline Identification}).

The following figure provides an example of CIs in a signalling system:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\caption{Signalling system CI example}
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{./Figure/CI_Example.png}
\end{figure}

The following sections describe how CIs are identified and managed in the openETCS project.


\subsubsection{CI Identification and Selection Process} % Subsection 3.1.1
\label{sec:CI Identification and Selection Process}

The identification and selection of CIs is an ongoing process that relies on the judgment and recommendations of people involved at all levels of the openETCS project. In most cases, the process will begin in the Scrum Teams of the individual work packages of the openETCS project.
The following figure gives a general overview of the CI identification and selection process:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\caption{CI identification and selection process}
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{./Figure/CI_Process.png}
\end{figure}

Process description:

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Work Package Leaders are responsible for starting and supervising the identification and selection of potential CIs in their WP. The identification and selection itself should involve people who are close to the subject matter (e.g. Scrum Teams). Criteria and a checklist for identifying potential CIs are provided in section \ref{sec:CI Identification and Selection Criteria}.
\item Potential CIs are reported to the QA Manager and the Configuration Manager.
\item QA Manager and Configuration Manager provide feedback regarding the suitability of the potential CI for configuration control. They also coordinate the decision process with the involved persons in the WP that has proposed the CI.
\item If the CI is suitable for configuration control, the Configuration Manager enters it in the Configuration Item Register. Attributes that must be provided for each CI are given in section \ref{sec:CI Attributes}.
\end{enumerate}

\textcolor{red}{Open: Define CI Register. Where are we planning to enter and maintain CI information? Open to review should be decided in a later stage depending on real needs that could arise in follow ups.}


\subsubsection{CI Identification and Selection Criteria} % Subsection 3.1.2
\label{sec:CI Identification and Selection Criteria}

The following general criteria can be used as a guideline when identifying and selecting CIs:

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Designating a component as a CI increases its visibility and control within the project. This is essential for system critical or high risk components.
\item Major functional design components should be designated as (aggregate) CIs. These components form a good starting point for the initial selection.
\item Complex (aggregate) CIs can be subdivided into individual CIs. This will likely happen during the design and development phases. Subordinate CIs should be functionally interrelated.
\item High level (aggregate) CIs should be separable entities that implement at least one function.
\item Operational software and support software should be differentiated as separate CIs.
\item Selecting a large number of CIs can lead to delays and increase costs.
\item Selecting very few CIs can mean that the individual CIs are unnecessarily complex and difficult to document and control. 
\end{itemize}

The following table can be used as a checklist to determine if an item should be designated as a CI (if there are more “yes” answers than “no” answers, it should probably be a CI):

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{m{12cm}m{1cm}m{1cm}}
\caption{CI checklist}\\

\hline \rowcolor{lightgrey} \multicolumn{1}{l}{Question} & \multicolumn{1}{l}{Yes} & \multicolumn{1}{l}{No} \\ \hline

\hline \rowcolor{lightgrey} \multicolumn{1}{l}{Question} & \multicolumn{1}{l}{Yes} & \multicolumn{1}{l}{No} \\ \hline
\endhead

\hline \hline
\endlastfoot

Is the item critical or high risk? Does failure of the item have a significant impact? & &\\\hline
Does the item implement critical functionality (e.g. collision avoidance)? Would control and verification of the functionality be increased by CI status? & &\\\hline
Does the item require changes in design or development? & &\\\hline
Is the item computer hardware or software? & &\\\hline
Does the item include untested technology? & &\\\hline
Does the item have an interface with another CI? & &\\\hline
Can the item be easily identified as an individual, controlled item? & &\\\hline
Is it necessary to track the configuration of the item over its lifecycle? & &\\\hline
Can or must the item be tested independently? & &\\\hline
Is the item released to the customer as a unit? & &\\\hline
Can the item be replaced as a unit? & &\\\hline
Does the item perform a meaningful stand-alone function? & &\\\hline
\end{longtable}
\end{center}


\subsubsection{CI Attributes} % Subsection 3.1.3
\label{sec:CI Attributes}

To ensure that a CI can be properly identified and traced by configuration control, it must be entered in the Configuration Item Register.

\textcolor{red}{Open: Where do we want to store CI information? Github? seems reasonable to have a version controlled repository related to the Open ETCS project structure: open to review}

The following table specifies which attributes should be available or are required for each CI:

\begin{center}

\end{longtable}
\end{center}

\textcolor{red}{Open: Review. Additional attributes? : open to review}


\subsubsection{CI Storage and Access} % Subsection 3.1.4
\label{sec:CI Storage and Access}

In addition to entering CI information in the Configuration Item Register, all CIs must be physically placed under configuration control. This means that procedures (including roles and responsibilities) have to be established for storage, retrieval and reproduction.

The following has to be specified (e.g. per CI class):

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Format
\item Location
\item Labelling
\item Reception and inspection (including documentation)
\item Access control
\item Tracking of controlled copies
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{red}{Open: Define. Will we simply keep everything in Github? open to review Github is the recognized repository and could be maintained}


\subsection{Baseline Identification} % Subsection 3.2
\label{sec:Baseline Identification}

At its core, a baseline is a snapshot of the software configuration or a defined part of the software configuration at a significant point in the software life cycle. This snapshot can then be used for comparison and as a basis for tracking and verifying changes in the configuration. Baselines are essential to maintaining software integrity.

As a general rule, a baseline must represent a defined, tested/reviewed and approved deliverable (e.g. the software requirements documentation or a stable release version). A baseline is formed by one or more CIs and, once defined and approved, is subject to configuration control. CIs that are part of a baseline are called baselined CIs (Note: CIs are sometimes also called baselined as soon as they are entered into an Configuration Item Register and become subject to configuration control).


\subsubsection{Defined Baselines} % Subsection 3.2.1
\label{sec:Defined Baselines}

The baselines for the openETCS project represent the milestones from requirements definition to release versions of the product, which is also reflected in the way the project is structured into work packages. The following table gives an overview of the defined baselines:

\begin{center}

\subsubsection{Baseline CI Identification and Selection Process} % Subsection 3.2.2
\label{sec:Baseline CI Identification and Selection Process}

The process of identifying and selecting which CIs (including the CI version) form a baseline must be carried out and approved at a sufficiently high level of the openETCS project, i.e. by the Work Package Leaders together with QA Manager and Configuration Manager.

The following figure gives a general overview of the process to identify and select which CIs form a baseline:

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{./Figure/Baseline_Process.png}
\end{figure}

Process description:

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Work Package Leaders together with the QA Manager and the Configuration Manager are responsible for identifying the CIs that belong to a specific baseline.
\item If a baseline includes a CI that has not been entered into the Configuration Item Register (i.e. placed under configuration control), the CI has to go through the CI identification and selection process (see section \ref{sec:CI Identification and Selection Process}).
\item Before the baseline can be approved, its CIs have to be tested and reviewed individually and as part of the baseline as a whole. If a CI is unsuitable, a change request can be initiated (see section \ref{sec:Configuration Control (Change Management)}).
\item The Work Package Leaders together with the QA Manager and the Configuration Manager decide if the baseline can be approved. If the baseline is approved, the Configuration Item Register is updated accordingly.
\end{enumerate}

\textcolor{blue}{Open: Are we tracking baselines through the CI Register? No closed}


\subsection{Configuration Control (Change Management)} % Subsection 3.3
\label{sec:Configuration Control (Change Management)}

Configuration control ensures that CIs are only changed after evaluation and approval. For the openETCS project, a corresponding change management process has been defined separately (see document Change/Problem Management Process in section \ref{sec:References}).


\subsection{Configuration Status Accounting} % Subsection 3.4
\label{sec:Configuration Status Accounting}

Configuration Status Accounting (CSA) is the process of tracking CIs through the steps in their evolution. Regular reports on the status and history of the CIs in the openETCS project are created to deliver the data required to measure project progress. The following data is tracked for each CI:

\textcolor{blue}{Open: The QA Plan lists a Software Assessment Plan and Software Assessment Report. Are the requirements below included there, meaning we can simply refer to it here? Yes Closed}

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Approved versions and revisions
\item Status of change requests
\item Implementation status of approved changes
\item Evaluations (Audits)
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{blue}{Note: IEEE 828-2005 names the above as the minimum. Noted}

If necessary, this data makes it possible to rebuild previous baselines. It is also used to track change requests and document the results of evaluations and reviews.

\textcolor{red}{Open: The following has to be documented in the SCMP:}

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{What data elements and SCM metrics are tracked and reported for baselines and
changes?
SCADE Model, SCDE generated code Integration code Test environment model test results}
\item \textcolor{blue}{What types of status accounting reports are generated (and their frequency)? srpint reviews on regular basis}
\item \textcolor{red}{How is information collected, stored, processed, reported, and protected from loss?}
\item \textcolor{red}{How is access to the status data is controlled?}
\end{itemize}
\textcolor{red}{open to further review }


\subsection{Configuration Evaluation and Review (Audits)} % Subsection 3.5
\label{sec:Configuration Evaluation and Review (Audits)}

CIs must be evaluated and reviewed (audited) to verify conformance to requirements defined, for example, in the specification documentation of the openETCS project or applicable standards. Audits of CIs must determine that a CI fulfills its required physical and functional characteristics.

\textcolor{blue}{Open: The QA Plan lists a Software Verification and Validation Plan (as well as Test, Validation and Verification Reports) and a Software Assessment Plan (and Software Assessment Report). Are those documents going to include the requirements below, meaning we can simply refer to them here? Yes Closed}


\subsubsection{Physical Configuration Audit} % Subsection 3.5.1
\label{sec:Physical Configuration Audit}

A Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) must be carried out prior to a software release or software update (i.e. before a new baseline). It includes all CIs that are part of the corresponding baseline. The PCA is performed to determine that all CIs (including documentation) are present in the correct version and match the data from the corresponding configuration status reports.

An unsuccessful audit (non-conformance) means that the software release or software update cannot take place.

\textcolor{blue}{Open: Roles and responsibilities? Process and schedule? Approval criteria and actions that occur upon approval? see \cite{ADD} closed}


\subsubsection{Functional Configuration Audit} % Subsection 3.5.2
\label{sec:Functional Configuration Audit}

A Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) is carried out for each CI (including documentation) to determine that it has been tested or inspected and fulfills the functions defined in the corresponding openETCS specifications.

An unsuccessful audit (non-conformance) means that the CI cannot be released (e.g. to be part of a baseline).

\textcolor{blue}{Open: Roles and responsibilities? Process and schedule? Approval criteria and actions that occur upon approval? see \cite{ADD} closed}


\subsubsection{Audit Reports} % Subsection 3.5.3
\label{sec:Audit Reports}

Every audit must be documented in a corresponding audit report with at least the following information:

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Auditor
\item Date
\item Audit reason/objective
\item CIs audited
\item Result for each CI
\item Overall result
\item Recipient of audit report
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{red}{Open: Others? see assesment report on github (internal-assesment repository)open to further review}


\subsubsection{Non-Conformance Follow-Up} % Subsection 3.5.4
\label{sec:Non-Conformance Follow-Up}

If a CI fails an audit, corresponding corrective actions have to be planned and implemented before a follow-up audit can be scheduled and carried out. 

\textcolor{blue}{Open: Roles and responsibilities? Process? see \cite{ADD}. for CI to be decided in later stage. closed}


\subsection{Interface Control} % Subsection 3.6
\label{sec:Interface Control}

CIs may interface with other items that are outside the scope of the SCMP. The interfacing items may remain outside of configuration control, but the interfaces have to be identified and controlled.

\textcolor{red}{Open: The QA Plan lists a Software Interface Specification. Does that document include the requirements below, meaning we can refer to it here? open to review}

The following information has to be defined for each interface:

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Interface nature/type
\item Affected CIs
\item Process to control interface code, documentation and data
\item Process to approve and release the interface
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{blue}{Open: Roles and responsibilities? Process? Do we track/control interfaces as part of individual CIs or as separate items? Is a separate Interface Management Plan planned? No Closed}


\subsection{Subcontractor/Vendor Control} % Subsection 3.7
\label{sec:Subcontractor/Vendor Control}

Software items developed outside the openETCS project must be placed under configuration management. This includes software developed by subcontractors or software acquired in finished form form another source. It may not be possible to treat CIs that are not developed internally the exact same way as CIs developed as part of the openETCS project.

If necessary, the following must be determined for subcontractor/vendor CIs:

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item SCM requirements the subcontractor has to fulfill
\item Compliance monitoring of the subcontractor
\item Evaluations and reviews of subcontractor CIs
\item Process to test, verify, accept and integrate subcontractor CIs into openETCS project
\item Handling of proprietary CIs (e.g. regarding copyright and royalties)
\item Handling of changes (e.g. participation of subcontractor/vendor)
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{red}{Open: Roles and responsibilities? Process? to be managed at a later stage, open to further review}


\subsection{Release Management and Delivery} % Subsection 3.8
\label{sec:Release Management and Delivery}

The build, release and delivery of software products and documentation by the openETCS project must be formally controlled. For the openETCS project, a corresponding Software Release and Deployment Plan has been defined separately (see corresponding reference in section \ref{sec:References}).

\newpage


\section{SCM Schedules} % Section 5
\label{sec:SCM Schedules}

Because there may be dependencies between the individual SCM activities or relationships between SCM activities and other project activities (e.g. milestones), some SCM activities  have to be carried out in sequence or according to a schedule.

\textcolor{blue}{Open: Do we have dependencies that require sequences/schedules? Are there milestones/events that require SCM activities? Is there some kind of timeline or something we could refer to? No closed}

\newpage


\section{SCM Resources} % Section 5
\label{sec:SCM Resources}

Carrying out the SCM activities defined in this SCMP requires resources. These resources may themselves be CIs that have to be placed under configuration control.

The following table lists the resources specified for each SCM activity:

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{m{3cm}m{4cm}m{3cm}m{4cm}}
\caption{SCM resources}\\

\hline \rowcolor{lightgrey} \multicolumn{1}{l}{SCM Activity} & \multicolumn{1}{l}{Tools/Techniques/Equipment} & \multicolumn{1}{l}{Personnel} & \multicolumn{1}{l}{Training} \\ \hline

\section{SCMP Maintenance} % Section 6
\label{sec:SCMP Maintenance}

SCM planning must continue throughout the life cycle of the openETCS project. This means the SCMP itself will be treated as a CI to ensure that the following information remains up-to-date:

\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item SCM responsibilities
\item SCMP updates (including change management/approval)
\item SCMP distribution
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\textcolor{blue}{Open: Why do we have an additional ''References'' section that basically repeats what is already listed in the ''References, Guidelines and Standards'' section? Is intended as an extensive reference including documents papers etc not only guidelines  and references : Closed}
